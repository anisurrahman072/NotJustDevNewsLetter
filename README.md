# React Native SDK Deep R&Ds

![](./images/ReactNativeScreen3.30/output.gif)

- Hi, React Native devs, I'm doing deep R&D on RN SDKs latest releases.
- Then I'm writing Newsletter for #NotJustDev about my R&D
- Each topic I choose are latest releases of different RN SDKs
- On an average I give 30+ hours for each R&D & Newsletter writing
